## My Approach:
In this competition I used simple **Multinomial Naive bayes** as base line model got F1 score around ~38 percent.

Then i have improved the score by testing 2 newself created variables from the data.

I improved modelling by using these new variables and F1 score increased to ~41.5 and finally **optimized parameters** secured 107 position in- -private leaderboard with score ~43.5

## Other Approaches which I had tried:
*Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) & 
*Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (QDA)

These approaches did were not able to tag the parameters successfully, and as a result the F1 score was close to 0.
